# AI Daily Productivity Report

This project automatically collects personal productivity data from GitHub and Clockify, generates a report using OpenAI, and emails it daily. The entire project was fully generated by AI.

## Setup Instructions


### 1. Create a GitHub Repository

- Create a new GitHub repository
- Push this code to the repository

### 2. Configure GitHub Secrets

In your GitHub repository, go to Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions and add the following secrets:

- `GH_TOKEN`: Your GitHub personal access token with `repo` and `user` scopes
- `GH_USERNAME`: Your GitHub username
- `GH_PROJECT_ID`: Your GitHub project ID (if tracking projects)
- `GH_PROJECT_NUMBER`: Your GitHub project number (if tracking projects)
- `CLOCKIFY_API_KEY`: Your Clockify API key from your user settings
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key from the OpenAI dashboard
- `OPENAI_MODEL`: OpenAI model to use (e.g., gpt-4-turbo)
- `SMTP_SERVER`: SMTP server address (e.g., smtp.gmail.com)
- `SMTP_PORT`: SMTP server port number
- `SMTP_USER`: Email username for sending reports
- `SMTP_PASSWORD`: Email password or app password
- `FROM_EMAIL`: Email address the report will be sent from
- `RECIPIENT_EMAILS`: Comma-separated list of email recipients

### 3. GitHub Actions

The workflow is configured to run daily at 18:00 Kyiv time (15:00 UTC). You can also manually trigger the workflow from the Actions tab.

## Project Structure

- `main.py`: Entry point that orchestrates the data collection and report generation
- `github/`: GitHub API integration
- `clockify/`: Clockify API integration
- `report/`: Report generation using OpenAI
- `mailer/`: Email functionality

## How It Works

1. The GitHub action triggers daily at 18:00 Kyiv time
2. It fetches your GitHub activity (commits, PRs, issues)
3. It retrieves time tracking data from Clockify
4. It generates a natural language report using OpenAI
5. It emails the report to the specified recipients
